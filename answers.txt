exercise 2
exploit-2a.py bug1 http.c:159
Pass a header longer than 512 bytes. This overflows value in http_request_headers, and also return address of http_request_headers.

exploit-2b.py bug3 http.c:282
Pass a request path longer than 1024 and overwrite handler in process_client

exercise 3
This exploits bug3, which overwrite value of handler. Other bugs can accomplish
this by overwrite return address in the stack.
