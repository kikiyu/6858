url_decode will copy value from sp to value, while sp is a pointer in buf,
which is of size 8192, and value is sizeof 512. So value may be 
overflowed.

    url_decode(value, sp);

[http.c:165]
sprintf copies buf into envvar, while buf is larger than envvar in size.
This may cause an overflow.

    sprintf(envvar, "HTTP_%s", buf);

[http.c:282]
The strcat may corrupt the stack, because size of 'name' may be larger 
than that of 'pn'.

    strcat(pn, name);

[http.c:94]
sprintf can corrupt envp and thus corrupt env.

    envp += sprintf(envp, "REQUEST_METHOD=%s", buf) + 1;

[zookd.c:105]
url_decode called in http_request_line may corrupt reqpath.

    url_decode(reqpath, sp1);
